# Part One: Centralized & Decentralized Finance

## Chapter 1. The Traditional Financial Institutions

- The banks: Top 10 banks $2T USD market cap.
- Services provided by banks: deposits, withdrawals, transfers, loans
- Shortcomings of banks: I.e. 2008 financial crisis

DeFi seeks to build a better financial system, particularly in:

- Payment & clearence system (remittance)
- Accesibility
- Centralization & transparency

Note: World Bank estimates that as of 2017, 1.7 billion people are unbanked.
Note: 2 thirds of the 1.7 billion have access to a mobile phone.

**DeFi's biggest strength lies in being able to cut out intermediaries and operate with zero censorship.**

**DeFi has pros and cons compared to traditional finance, we aim to teach how to use its best features to solve real-world problems.**

## Chapter 2. What is Decentralized Finance?

Definition: **Decentralized finance** or DeFi is the movement that allows users to utilize financial services such as borrowing, lending and trading without the need to rely on centralized entities. These financial services are provided via dapps, most of them living in the Ethereum platform.

Generally, to use DeFi dapps, you require to put up some collateral. The cumulative collateral locked in DeFi Dapps is often referred to as **Total Value Locked** (TVL).

Decentralization in DeFi is a spectrum:

1. Centralized

Traits: Custodial, centralized price feeds, centralized interest rates, centralized liquidity for margin calls, etc.
Examples: Salt, BlockFi, Nexo, Celsius

2. Semi-decentralized

Traits: Non-custodial, decentralized price feeds, permisionless initiation of margin calls, permissionless margin liquidity, decentralized platform development (dapps have some of these characteristics but not all)
Examples: Compound, MakerDAO, dYdX, bZx

3. Completely decentralized

Traits: Every component is decentralized
Examples: No DeFi protocol is completely decentralized yet

### DeFi Key Categories

1. Stablecoins
2. Lending and borrowing
3. Exchanges
4. Derivatives
5. Fund management
6. Lottery
7. Payments
8. Insurance

# Part Two: Getting into DeFi

## Chapter 3: The Decentralized Layer: Ethereum

What is Ethereum?

A global, open-source platform for decentralized applications.
Developers write smart contracts that control digital value, these smart contracts once deployed are available 24/7.

What is a smart contract?

A program (code) that allows 2 counterparties to set conditions of a transaction without involving a third party. Smart contracts work on an "if this, then that" principle.

Multiple smart contracts can be combined to create complex use cases within dapps.

What is Ether?

Ether is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Ether can be sent and received in transactions just like bitcoin. Moreover, Ether is used to pay for the fee that allows dapps to run on the Ethereum network.

What is gas?

Gas is the unit of measure of the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation on a smart contract. The more complex the operation, the more gas required. Gas fees are paid in ETH.

What are Decentralized Applications (Dapps)?

Dapps generally consist of an interface for the regular user to interact with, plus a bunch of smart contracts (the 'backend') that interact with the blockchain.

What are the benefits of dapps?

- Immutability
- Tamper-proof
- Transparent
- Availability

What are the disavantages of dapps?

- Immutability
- Transparent
- Scability

What else can Ethereum be used for?

Ethereum can also be used for creating DAOs or issuing other cryptocurrencies (tokens).

Most popular protocols for token creation:

ERC-20: Regular, fungible tokens.
ERC-721: Non-fungible tokens.

## Chapter 4: Ethereum Wallets

**A wallet is a user friendly interface to the blockchain network. It manages your private keys. Wallets allow you to receive, store and send cryptocurrencies.**

### Custodial wallets

Third-parties maintain control over your cryptocurrencies on your behalf.

### Non custodial wallets

You take full ownership and responsibility for your funds.

"Not your keys, not your coins".

### Recommended:

Mobile non custodial: Argent
https://www.argent.xyz/

Desktop non custodial: Metamask

Metamask acts as a wallet and as an interaction bridge. You can store Ethereum and ERC20 tokens on Metamask. Without an interaction bridge, your browser wouldn't be able to access the Ethereum blockchain unless you were running a full Ethereum node.

Metamask accomplishes this by injecting a javascript library known as web3.js

# Part Three: Deep diving into DeFi

## Chapter 5: Decentralized stablecoins

Qué problema resuelven las stablecoins? Volatility.

Top 5 Cryptocurrency Stablecoins in 2022

1. Tether (USDT)
2. USD Coin (USDC)
3. Binance USD (BUSD)
4. Terra USD (UST)
5. Dai (DAI)

Stablecoins have different mechanisms for maintaining their peg to their target fiat currency. Basically there are two types of pegs: fiat-collateralized and crypto-collateralized.

Example 1: Tether pegs itself to USD by maintaining (allegedly) reserves of $1 per Tether token minted. Tether is centralized, fiat-collateralized stablecoin.

Dai is collateralized using cryptocurrencies such as ETH. DAI is decentralized, crypto-collateralized coin.

DAI is the native stablecoin used most widely in the DeFi ecosystem. DAI is created by Maker.

### What is Maker?
